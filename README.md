## Predicting the probability of default of Credit Card clients

## About this Dataset

A study was conducted in Taiwan named “The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients”

This research aimed at the case of customers’ default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default.

The study took payment data in October 2005, from an important bank (a cash and credit card issuer) in Taiwan, and the targets were credit card holders of the bank.

This research employed a binary variable – default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable.

The past monthly payment records (from April to September 2005), the amount of bill statement, and sever other demographic features were captured for each customer.

This dataset has 30,000 records
